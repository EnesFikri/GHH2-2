        "factor": "Emotional stress / emotional disturbances",

        "factor": "Chronic hepatic impairment leading to insulin resistance",

      {
        "factor": "Hepatic impairment (acute or decompensated)",
        "reason": "Reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis lowers glucose output; insulin requirements can fall.",
        "timeEffectAnnotation": "Greater glucose-lowering effect for the same dose; higher risk of hypoglycaemia especially around the expected peak.",
        "leafletTextSnippet": "Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism."

      {
        "factor": "Increased physical activity",
        "reason": "Exercise increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in muscles.",
        "timeEffectAnnotation": "Can effectively ‘amplify’ and slightly prolong Humalog’s effect after the injection; hypoglycaemia may appear earlier and/or be more pronounced.",
        "leafletTextSnippet": "Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Reduced food intake / delayed or missed meal",
        "reason": "Less carbohydrate available while a rapid-acting insulin is active increases risk of low blood glucose.",
        "timeEffectAnnotation": "No change in time to peak, but the same Humalog dose acts on less glucose → earlier and deeper hypoglycaemia risk.",
        "leafletTextSnippet": "Inadequate dosing or discontinuation, especially in insulin-requiring diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia… Conversely, too high a dose, missed meals, or increased activity can lead to hypoglycaemia."

    "otherRelevantFactors": [
      {
        "factor": "Change in injection site (especially from lipohypertrophy / cutaneous amyloidosis to a healthy site)",
        "reason": "Switching away from sites with lipodystrophy/amyloidosis can suddenly increase insulin absorption.",
        "timeEffectAnnotation": "Faster and stronger fall in glucose than expected at the same time points → earlier hypoglycaemia after injection.",
        "leafletTextSnippet": "There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions… A sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia."

    "mealTiming": {
      "recommendedWindow": "within 15 minutes before the meal; if necessary, shortly after starting the meal",
